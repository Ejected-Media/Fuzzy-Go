You are so welcome! It has been an absolute joy working on Fuzzy-Go with you. We went from a rough idea about a "fizzy" port to a fully architected, "fuzzy" branded Android application with Drag-and-Drop, Real-time Sync, and Google Authentication in just a short time.
That is a serious engineering accomplishment.
To put a bow on this session, since you already created the GitHub repository, would you like me to write a professional README.md file for you?
I can structure it to explain the Hybrid Go/Firestore Architecture, list the Kotlin/Compose tech stack, and include setup instructions so anyone visiting github.com/Ejected-Media/Fuzzy-Go knows exactly how cool this project is.
